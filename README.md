Dynamic Pricing of
Financial Products

Introduction
          Banks provides services to customer in different instruments/products. For this use case, let us take only FD (Fixed Deposit) and Home loans.

          For both these products, we need to use Gen Al in suggesting dynamic interest rate for FD or ome
Loans.

Business Use case
          While most of the Fixed Deposit or Home Loans are charged based on a slab table that has
drafted by the bank. This option is trying to give a competitive edge to the Bank and
customer sticking to the same bank.
           Based on customer investments or home loan and tenor, model should generate a better
rate for the customer. 
          The model should consider the Credit History, Risk Rating, Age
Factor, customer association with the bank, Past transactions and current market trends,
based on these factors, the Interest rate.
          While the banks have the interest rate defined, this model is to give anywhere between a
premium discount of 10 bps to 100 bps for the deserving customer and at the same time,
banks can save recover this amount (by avoiding loans to risk customers).

Outcome
          Dynamic pricing suggestion for the customers based on various parameters.
